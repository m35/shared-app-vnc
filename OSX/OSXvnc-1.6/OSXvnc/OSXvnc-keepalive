# OSXvnc-keepalive 
#
# This little script, as you might imagine, will relaunch OSXvnc-server
# when a user logs out and the OS kills the process (because it's running an event loop)
# 
# Modification Log:
#
# 1.5
# Replace spurious ls -l entry with a much more appropriate pwd
#
# 1.4
# Uses proper -lt and checks for less than 200 rather than more than 0 since process only return unsigned shorts
#
# 1.33
# Modified so that keepalive only shuts down on unrecoverable errors
#
# 1.31
# Modified so that OSXvnc can live in directories with spaces
#
# 1.11
# Initial version

RESULT=15
pwd
# OS X will send a SIGINT or SIGTERM to shutdown OSXvnc-server
# On a negative SIGNAL we'll stop properly (this is what the server returns internally when an error occurs)

	echo "$0: Starting Server"
	"$@" # Run our parameters
	RESULT=$? # Record Result
