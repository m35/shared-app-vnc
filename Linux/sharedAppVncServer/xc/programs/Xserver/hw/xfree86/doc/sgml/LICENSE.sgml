and Sections 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12 and 13 of this License, which terms may

or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or

been distributed.

8. Claims of Infringement. If Recipient at any time has knowledge of any
one or more third party claims that reproduction, modification, use,
distribution, import or sale of Subject Software (including particular
functionality or code incorporated in Subject Software) infringes the
third party's intellectual property rights, Recipient must place in a
well-identified web page bearing the title "LEGAL" a description of each

such claim, Recipient must conspicuously include the URL for such web
page in the Exhibit A notice required under Sections 2 and 3, above, and
in the text of any related documentation, license agreement or
collateral in which Recipient describes end user's rights relating to

Subject Software available to any other person or entity, Recipient
shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or
newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the
Subject Software that new knowledge has been obtained.

9. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE SUBJECT SOFTWARE IS
FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-

CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SGI's NEGLIGENCE
TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO
RECIPIENT.

11. Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages
arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under
this License. Recipient will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Silicon
Graphics, Inc. from and against any loss, liability, damages, costs or
expenses (including the payment of reasonable attorneys fees) arising
out of Recipient's use, modification, reproduction and distribution of
the Subject Software or out of any representation or warranty made by
Recipient.

United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that
the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall
