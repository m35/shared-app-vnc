                  Release Notes for XFree86[tm] 4.3.99.902

                          The XFree86 Project, Inc

                              18 December 2003

                                  Abstract

     This document contains some information about features present in
     XFree86 4.3.99.902 and their status.

1.  Introduction to the 4.x Release Series

XFree86 4.0 was the first official release of the new XFree86 4 series.
XFree86 4 represents a significant redesign of the XFree86 X server.  Not all
of the hardware drivers from 3.3.x have been ported to 4.x yet, but con-
versely, 4.x has support for a lot of hardware that is not supported in
3.3.x.  Our Driver Status document summarizes how the hardware driver support
compares between 3.3.6 and 4.3.99.902.  Please check there first before down-
loading 4.3.99.902.

XFree86 4.4 introduces an automatic configuration mechanism for the XFree86
server.  This makes it possible to start XFree86 in a usable way without
first creating a configuration file.  The initial automatic configuration
support is currently targetted towards Linux and FreeBSD.  Automatic configu-
ration will be supported on other platforms in future releases.  If you're
running Linux or FreeBSD, try it out if you don't already have a working
XF86Config file.  If you want to customise things afterwards, you can cut and
paste the automatically generated configuration from the
/var/log/XFree86.0.log file into an XF86Config file and make your customisa-
tions there.  Runtime and dynamic configuration is planned for future
releases.

If you don't have any luck with automatic configuration, or you are using a
platform that it isn't currently supported on, try one of the older methods
for getting started.

XFree86 comes with a graphical configuration tool called "xf86cfg".  It also
has a text mode interface.  It can be used to create an iniital configuration
file, and to customise existing configurations.

Next in the order of configuration preferences is to make use of the XFree86
server's ability to create a starting configuration file.  To do this, just
run (as root):

     XFree86 -configure

and follow the instructions.

Finally, the trusty old text-based tool "xf86config" can also be used for
generating X server config files.

At least one of these configuration options will give you a reasonable start-
ing point for a suitable configuration file.  With the automatic mechanism
you might even find that you don't need one!  If you do need to customise the
configuration file, you can find it fully documented in the XF86Config manual
page.  Also check the driver-specific manual pages and the related documenta-
tion for further information.  References to this driver-specific information
can be found in the tables below (section 3., page 1).

Before you go to download and install the binary distributions for this
release, please have a quick read through the Installation Document.  It may
save you some time and help you figure out which of the binary releases you
need.

The other sections below describe some of the new features and changes
between 3.3.x and 4.0.  There are lot's of new features, and we definitely
don't have enough space to cover them all here.

2.  Summary of new features in 4.4.0.

2.1  Video Driver Enhancements

   o Several stability issues with the support for the Intel 830M, 845G,
     852GM, 855GM and 865G integrated graphics chipsets have been fixed.
     Some limitations related to the driver's use of the video BIOS remain,
     especially for some laptops.

   o The nv driver for NVIDIA cards has been updated as follows:

        o Support added to the nv driver for the GeForce FX 5700, which
          didn't work with XFree86 4.3.

        o The driver now does a much better job of autodetecting which con-
          nector of dual output cards the monitor is attached to, which
          should reduce or eliminate the need for manual XF86Config over-
          rides.

        o The 2D acceleration for TNT and GeForce was completely rewritten.
          Performance should be substantiallly improved.

        o TNT and GeForce cards have a new Xv PutImage adaptor which does
          scaled YUV bit blits.

   o The SiS driver has seen major updates, including:

        o Support for 661/741/760 and support for 330 (Xabre).

        o Merged Framebuffer mode.

        o Support for DVI, and much more.

        o DRI for 300 series (300/305, 540, 630, 730) is supported again.

   o A new driver for several VIA integrated graphics chipsets has been
     added.

   o Various updates and bug fixes have been made to most other drivers.

2.2  Input Driver Enhancements

   o The mouse driver has some support on Linux and FreeBSD for auto-detect-
     ing the device node to use, making it unnecessary to supply this infor-
     mation in the XF86Config file in most cases.

2.3  IPv6 support

XFree86 4.4 supports IPv6, based on the code contributed by Sun Microsystems
to X.Org. See X.org's document <URL:http://www.x.org/IPV6_Spe-
cific_Changes.html> for a detailled list of the changes.

2.3.1  Protocol names and aliases.

   o tcp is an alias for both IPv6 and IPv4 transports.

   o inet specifies IPv4 only.

   o inet6 specifies IPv6 only.

You can force the X server to only listen to IPv4 connections with the X
-nolisten inet6  command.  Or you can force a IPv6 connection by setting DIS-
PLAY to inet6/host:0.

2.3.2  XDM

The IPv6 XDMCP code is not enabled by default on platforms that don't support
binding a IPv6 socket to a IPv4 address.

The XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 authentification scheme does not support IPv6
addresses. A new release of the protocol, XDM-AUTHORIZATION-2 has been
designed, but is not implemented yet.  Note that  by default XFree86 builds
do not enable the XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 code.

2.4  X Server and Extension Updates

   o The Mesa version used for OpenGL® 1.3 and DRI driver support has been
     updated to 5.0.2.

2.5  Client and Library Updates

2.5.1  Xterm

The user-visible changes to xterm since XFree86 4.3 are:

Bug Fixes:

   o Make signalInhibit resource work, i.e., disable the menu entries that
     would send signals to, or exit xterm.

   o Make cursor definition in tek4014 emulation work as originally imple-
     mented.

   o Modify translations for scrollbar so that one can use shifted pageup,
     wheel mouse, etc., while the mouse pointer is over the scrollbar.

   o Correct initialization of G1 character set mapping.

New Features:

   o Modify the predictable version of the generated logfile name to append
     the process-id rather than a random value.

   o Modify scroll-back and scroll-forw actions to accept an adjustment
     value, e.g.,

          scroll-back(1, page-2)

     to scroll back by 2 lines less than a page.

   o Add visualBellDelay resource to modify the length of time used for
     visual bell, for very slow displays or very fast computers.

Improved Locale Support:

   o modify uxterm script to strip modifiers such as "@euro" from the locale
     setting before adding ".UTF-8".

   o Add logic to wide-character support which attempts to load fonts speci-
     fied by utf8Fonts subresources at startup.  The subresources have the
     same names as the fonts which they replace, e.g., font, font1, etc., so
     that the ISO-10646-1 fonts can be specified in the XTerm app-defaults
     file.

   o Improved performance with chinput application.

Improved Font Handling:

   o Document in xterm's manpage how to use XFree86 ":unscaled" keyword to
     suppress scaling of bold fonts.

   o Improved logic for deriving bold fontname from normal fontname.

   o Make double-width characters work with -u8 option.

   o Updated table of Unicode line-drawing characters.

   o Several fixes for rendering using Xft (option -fa):

        o Make height of TrueType fonts match ascent+descent.

        o Translate Unicode values (from UTF-8 output to xterm) for line-
          drawing to xterm's internal code, etc., since TrueType fonts gener-
          ally do not have either set of line-drawing glyphs.  xterm can draw
          these directly.

        o Pass 16-bit values rather than 8-bit values to xtermXftDrawString()
          to allow for wide-characters.

        o Use built-in line-drawing characters for Xft fonts.

        o Implement underlining.

   o Implement boldMode for wide-characters.

   o Modified to work with CJK double-width (bi-width/monospace) fonts.

Workarounds for Special Applications:

   o Add option -k8 and resource allowC1Printable to allow users of non-VTxxx
     character sets such as KOI-8 to treat the C1 control area (character
     codes 128-159) as printable rather than control characters.

   o Add configure option --enable-broken-st and resource brokenStringTerm to
     allow user to revert one part of the parsing table corrections.

   o Add configure option --enable-broken-osc and resource brokenLinuxOSC to
     accommodate scripts which do not distinguish between running in the
     Linux console and running in X.  Linux console recognizes malformed con-
     trol strings which start with an OSC, but are fixed-length, with no ter-
     minator.

   o Add configure option --enable-pty-handshake to allow one to compile-in
     support for the pty handshaking logic, and resource ptyHandshake to
     enable or disable it.  This feature is normally enabled.

Modified Resources:

   o Change color4 to "dodger blue", since this provides better contrast.

   o Remove color resources from XTerm.ad, leaving them only in XTerm-col.ad

   o Modify UXTerm.ad resource file to include "XTerm-color" rather than
     "XTerm", in case the latter file contains no color resource definitions.

   o Changed class of veryBoldColors to VeryBoldColors, since ColorMode is
     associated with boolean resources.

   o Changed classes of colorBDMode and similar resources that override col-
     ors when a video attribute is set to ColorAttrMode, to make them dis-
     tinct from ColorMode.  This avoids an unexpected rendering of reverse
     video, for example.

Modified terminfo/termcap entries:

   o Add indp and rin to terminfo entry.

   o Add le to termcap xterm-basic entry.  Though missing from older termcaps
     for xterm, some applications check for it.

   o Correct AF/AB strings in termcap for xterm-256color and xterm-88color
     entries.

2.6  I18N and Font Updates

   o FreeType2 updated to version 2.1.4.

   o The "freetype" X server font backend has been updated by the After X-TT
     Project <URL:http://x-tt.sourceforge.jp/> to include the functionality
     previously provided by the "xtt" backend, and to fix some bugs.  The
     "xtt" backend will be dropped in the next release in favour of the
     updated unified "freetype" backend.

2.7  OS Support Updates

   o On Mac OS X, the appropriate backend drawing code is now dynamically
     loaded at runtime. This reduces the X server's memory footprint.  In
     rootless mode, Apple's Xplugin library is used where available.  (Xplu-
     gin is included as part of Mac OS X on Panther.) With Xplugin, XDarwin
     provides identical performance to Apple's X11, including the following
     improvements over 4.3:

        o Added direct GLX rendering with thread support.

        o Faster 2-D drawing.

        o Added support for the Apple-WM extension so XDarwin interoperates
          with quartz-wm.

   o On Darwin, IOKit mode now uses shadowfb for much faster drawing.

   o Various GNU/Hurd support updates.

   o Experimental support added for GNU/KFreeBSD and GNU/KNetBSD systems.

A more complete list of changes can be found in the CHANGELOG that is part of
the XFree86 source tree.  It can also be viewed online at our CVSweb server

4.  Overview of XFree86 4.x.

XFree86 4.x has a single X server binary called XFree86.  This binary can
either have one or more video and input drivers linked in statically, or,
more usually, dynamically load the video drivers, input drivers, and other
modules that are needed.

XFree86 4.3.99.902 has X server support for most UNIX® and UNIX-like operat-
ing systems on Intel/x86 platforms, plus support for Linux and some BSD OSs
on Alpha, PowerPC, IA-64, AMD64, Sparc, and Mips platforms, and for Darwin on
PowerPC.  Work on support for additional architectures and operating systems
is in progress, and is planned for future releases.

4.1  Loader and Modules

The XFree86 X server has a built-in run-time loader developed from code
donated by Metro Link <URL:http://www.metrolink.com>.  This loader can load
normal object files and libraries in most of the commonly used formats.
Since the loader doesn't rely on an operating system's native dynamic loader
support, it works on platforms that don't provide this feature, and makes it
possible for the modules to be operating system independent (although not, of
course, independent of CPU architecture).  This means that a module compiled
on Linux/x86 can be loaded by an X server running on Solaris/x86, or FreeBSD,
or even OS/2.

One of the main benefits of this loader is that when modules are updated,
they do not need to be recompiled for every different operating system.

The loader in version 4.3.99.902 has support for Intel (x86), Alpha and Pow-
erPC platforms.  It also has preliminary support for Sparc platforms.

The X server makes use of modules for video drivers, X server extensions,
font rasterisers, input device drivers, framebuffer layers (like mfb, cfb,
etc), and internal components used by some drivers (like XAA),

The module interfaces (API and ABI) used in this release is subject to change
without notice.  While we will attempt to provide backward compatibility for
the module interfaces as of the 4.0 release (meaning that 4.0 modules will
work with future core X server binaries), we cannot guarantee this.  Compati-
bility in the other direction is explicitly not guaranteed because new mod-
ules may rely on interfaces added in new releases.

Note about module security

     The XFree86 X server runs with root privileges, i.e.  the X server
     loadable modules also run with these privileges.  For this reason
     we recommend that all users be careful to only use loadable modules
     from reliable sources,  otherwise the introduction of viruses and
     contaminated code can occur and wreak havoc on your system.  We
     hope to have a mechanism for signing/verifying the modules that we
     provide available in a future release.

4.2  Configuration File

The XFree86 server uses a configuration file as the primary mechanism for
providing configuration and run-time parameters.  The configuration file for-
mat is described in detail in the XF86Config(5) manual page.

The XFree86 server has support for automatically determining an initial con-
figuration on most platforms, as well as support or generating a basic ini-
tial configuration file.

4.3  Command Line Options

Command line options can be used to override some default parameters and
parameters provided in the configuration file.  These command line options
are described in the XFree86(1) manual page.

4.4  XAA

The XFree86 Acceleration Architecture (XAA) was completely rewritten from
scratch for XFree86 4.x.  Most drivers implement acceleration by making use
of the XAA module.

4.5  Multi-head

Some multi-head configurations are supported in XFree86 4.x, primarily with
multiple PCI/AGP cards.

One of the main problems is with drivers not sufficiently initialising cards
that were not initialised at boot time.  This has been improved somewhat with
the INT10 support that is used by most drivers (which allows secondary card
to be "soft-booted", but in some cases there are other issues that still need
to be resolved.  Some combinations can be made to work better by changing
which card is the primary card (either by using a different PCI slot, or by
changing the system BIOS's preference for the primary card).

4.6  Xinerama

Xinerama is an X server extension that allows multiple physical screens to
behave as a single screen.  With traditional multi-head in X11, windows can-
not span or cross physical screens.  Xinerama removes this limitation.  Xin-
erama does, however, require that the physical screens all have the same root
depth, so it isn't possible, for example, to use an 8-bit screen together
with a 16-bit screen in Xinerama mode.

Xinerama is not enabled by default, and can be enabled with the +xinerama
command line option for the X server.

Xinerama was included with X11R6.4.  The version included in XFree86 4.x was
completely rewritten for improved performance and correctness.

Known problems:

   o Most window managers are not Xinerama-aware, and so some operations like
     window placement and resizing might not behave in an ideal way.  This is
     an issue that needs to be dealt with in the individual window managers,
     and isn't specifically an XFree86 problem.

4.7  DGA version 2

DGA 2.0 is included in 4.3.99.902.  Documentation for the client libraries
can be found in the XDGA(3) man page.  A good degree of backwards compatibil-
ity with version 1.0 is provided.

4.8  DDC

The VESA® Display Data Channel (DDC[tm]) standard allows the monitor to tell
the video card (or on some cases the computer directly) about itself; partic-
ularly the supported screen resolutions and refresh rates.

Partial or complete DDC support is available in most of the video drivers.
DDC is enabled by default, but can be disabled with a "Device" section entry:
Option "NoDDC".  We have support for DDC versions 1 and 2; these can be dis-
abled independently with Option "NoDDC1" and Option "NoDDC2".

At startup the server prints out DDC information from the display, and can
use this information to set the default monitor parameters, or to warn about
monitor sync limits if those provided in the configuration file don't match
those that are detected.

4.8.1  Changed behavior caused by DDC.

Several drivers uses DDC information to set the screen size and pitch.  This
can be overridden by explicitly resetting it to the and non-DDC default value
75 with the -dpi 75 command line option for the X server, or by specifying
appropriate screen dimensions with the "DisplaySize" keyword in the "Monitor"
section of the config file.

4.9  GLX and the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI)

Direct rendered OpenGL® support is provided for several hardware platforms by
the Direct Rendering Infrastructure (DRI).  Further information about DRI can
be found at the DRI Project's web site <URL:http://dri.sf.net/>.  The 3D core
rendering component is provided by Mesa <URL:http://www.mesa3d.org>.

4.10  XVideo Extension (Xv)

The XVideo extension is supported in XFree86 4.x.  An XvQueryPortAttributes
function has been added as well as support for XvImages.  XvImages are XIm-
ages in alternate color spaces such as YUV and can be passed to the server
through shared memory segments.  This allows clients to display YUV data with
high quality hardware scaling and filtering.

4.11  X Rendering Extension (Render)

The X Rendering extension provides a 2D rendering model that more closely
matches application demands and hardware capabilities.  It provides a render-
ing model derived from Plan 9 based on Porter/Duff image composition rather
than binary raster operations.

Using simple compositing operators provided by most hardware, Render can draw
anti-aliased text and geometric objects as well as perform translucent image
overlays and other image operations not possible with the core X rendering
system.

XFree86 4.3.99.902 provides a partial implementation of Render sufficient for
drawing anti-aliased text and image composition.  Still to be implemented are
geometric primitives and affine transformation of images.

Unlike the core protocol, Render provides no font support for applications,
rather it allows applications to upload glyphs for display on the screen.
This allows the client greater control over text rendering and complete
access to the available font information while still providing hardware
acceleration.  The Xft library provides font access for Render applications.

4.11.1  The Xft Library

On the client side, the Xft library provides access to fonts for applications
using the FreeType library, version 2.  FreeType currently supports Type1 and
TrueType font files, a future release is expected to support BDF and PCF
files as well, so Render applications will have access to the complete range
of fonts available to core applications.  One important thing to note is that
Xft uses the vertical size of the monitor to compute accurate pixel sizes for
provided point sizes; if your monitor doesn't provide accurate information
via DDC, you may want to add that information to XF86Config.

To allow a graceful transition for applications moving from core text render-
ing to the Render extension, Xft can use either core fonts or FreeType and
the Render extension for text.  By default, Xft is configured to support both
core fonts and FreeType fonts using the supplied version of FreeType 2.  See
the section on FreeType support in Xft for instructions on configuring
XFree86 to use an existing FreeType installation.

The Xft library uses a configuration file, XftConfig, which contains informa-
tion about which directories contain font files and also provides a sophisti-
cated font aliasing mechanism.  Documentation for that file is included in
the Xft(3) man page.

4.11.2  FreeType support in Xft

XFree86 4.3.99.902 includes sources for FreeType version 2.1.4, and, by
default, they are built and installed automatically.

4.11.3  Application Support For Anti-Aliased Text

Only three applications have been modified in XFree86 4.3.99.902 to work with
the Render extension and the Xft and FreeType libraries to provide anti-
aliased text.  Xterm, xditview and x11perf.  Migration of other applications
may occur in future releases.

By default, xterm uses core fonts through the standard core API.  It has a
command line option and associated resource to direct it to use Xft instead:

   o -fa family / .VT100.faceName: family.  Selects the font family to use.

Xditview will use Xft instead of the core API by default.  X11perf includes
tests to measure the performance of text rendered in three ways, anti-
aliased, anti-aliased with sub-pixel sampling and regular chunky text, but
through the Render extension, a path which is currently somewhat slower than
core text.

4.12  Other extensions

The XFree86-Misc extension has not been fully ported to the new server archi-
tecture yet.  This should be completed in a future release.

The XFree86-VidModeExtension extension has been updated, and mostly ported to
the new server architecture.  The area of mode validation needs further work,
and the extension should be used with care.  This extension has support for
changing the gamma setting at run-time, for modes where this is possible.
The xgamma utility makes use of this feature.  Compatibility with the 3.3.x
version of the extension is provided.  The missing parts of this extension
and some new features should be completed in a future release.

4.13  xedit

Xedit has several new features, including:

   o An embedded lisp interpreter that allows easier extension of the editor.

   o Several new syntax highlight modes, and indentation rules for C and
     Lisp.

   o Flexible search/replace interface that allows regex matches.

   o Please refer to xedit(1) for more details.

4.14  Font support

Details about the font support in XFree86 4.x can be found in the
README.fonts document.

4.15  TrueType support

XFree86 4.x comes with two TrueType backends, known as "FreeType" backend
(the "freetype" module) and `X-TrueType' (the "xtt" module).  Both of these
backends are based on the FreeType library.  The functionality of X-TrueType
has been merged into the FreeType backend by the After X-TT Project for
XFree86 4.4.  Consequently, the old X-TrueType backend will be dropped as of
XFree86 4.5.

4.16  CID font support

Support for CID-keyed fonts is included in XFree86 4.x.  The CID-keyed font
format was designed by Adobe Systems <URL:http://www.adobe.com> for fonts
with large character sets.  The CID-keyed font support in XFree86 was donated
by SGI <URL:http://www.sgi.com>.  See the LICENSE document for a copy of the
CID Font Code Public License.

4.17  Internationalisation of the scalable font backends

XFree86 4.x has a ``fontenc'' layer to allow the scalable font backends to
use a common method of font re-encoding.  This re-encoding makes it possible
to uses fonts in encodings other than their their native encoding.  This
layer is used by the Type1 and Speedo backends and the `xfsft' version of the
TrueType backend.  The `X-TrueType' version of the TrueType backend uses a
different re-encoding method based on loadable encoding modules.

4.18  Large font optimisation

The glyph metrics array, which all the X clients using a particular font have
access to, is placed in shared memory, so as to reduce redundant memory con-
sumption.  For non-local clients, the glyph metrics array is transmitted in a
compressed format.

4.19  Unicode/ISO 10646 support

What is included in 4.x:

   o All ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF fonts are now available in the ISO10646-1
     encoding and cover at least the 614 characters found in ISO
     8859-{1-5,7-10,14,15}, CP1252, and MES-1. The non-bold fonts also cover
     all Windows Glyph List 4 (WGL4) characters, including those found in all
     8-bit MS-DOS/Windows code pages. The 8-bit variants of the ``-misc-
     fixed-*'' BDF fonts (ISO8859-1, ISO8859-2, KOI8-R, etc.) have all been
     automatically generated from the new ISO10646-1 master fonts.

   o Some ``-misc-fixed-*'' BDF ISO10646-1 fonts now cover a comprehensive
     Unicode repertoire of over 3000 characters including all Latin, Greek,
     Cyrillic, Armenian, Gregorian, Hebrew, IPA, and APL characters, plus
     numerous scientific, typographic, technical, and backwards-compatibility
     symbols. Some of these fonts also cover Arabic, Ethiopian, Thai,
     Han/Kanji, Hangul, full ISO 8859, and more. For the 6x13 font there is
     now a 12x13ja Kanji extension and for the 9x18 font there is a 18x18ja
     Kanji/Han/Hangul extension, which covers all ISO-2022-JP-2 (RFC 1554)
     characters. The 9x18 font can also be used to implement simple combining
     characters by accent overstriking. For more information, read Markus
     Kuhn's UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ <URL:http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/uni-
     code.html>.

   o Mark Leisher's ClearlyU proportional font (similar to Computer Modern).

   o ISO 10646/Unicode UTF-8 Level 1 support added to xterm (enabled with the
     -u8 option).

   o Both the xfsft (the "freetype" module) and the X-TrueType (the "xtt"
     module) TrueType font backends support Unicode-encoded fonts.

4.20  Luxi fonts from Bigelow and Holmes

XFree86 now includes the ``Luxi'' family of Type 1 fonts and TrueType fonts.
This family consists of the fonts ``Luxi Serif'', ``Luxi Sans'' and
``Luxi Mono'' in Roman, oblique, bold and bold oblique variants.  The True-
Type version have glyphs covering the basic ASCII Unicode range, the Latin 1
range, as well as the Extended Latin range and some additional punctuation
characters.  In particular, these fonts include all the glyphs needed for
ISO 8859 parts 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 13 and 15, as well as all the glyphs in the
Adobe Standard encoding and the Windows 3.1  character set.

The glyph coverage of the Type 1 versions is somewhat reduced, and only cov-
ers ISO 8859 parts 1, 2 and 15 as well as the Adobe Standard encoding.

The Luxi fonts are original designs by Kris Holmes and Charles Bigelow from
Bigelow and Holmes Inc., who developed the Luxi typeface designs in Ikarus
digital format.  URW++ Design and Development GmbH converted the Ikarus for-
mat fonts to TrueType and Type 1 font programs and implemented the grid-fit-
ting "hints" and kerning tables in the Luxi fonts.

The license terms for the Luxi fonts are included in the file `COPYRIGHT.BH',
as well as in the License document.  For further information, please contact
<design@bigelowandholmes.com> or <info@urwpp.de>, or consult the URW++ web
site <URL:http://www.urwpp.de>.
