General usage:
  Run the vnc viewer appliation on a workstation that would like to view the shared windows. The viewer will automatically listen for new connections.
  Run the vnc server application on a workstation from which you want to share windows.
  Run the javactrl application on the workstation running vnc server. This will allow you to control the server. The javactrl can have the server initiate a connection to a viewer using menu:client:connect. The client will typically be listening on port 5500, so the connect string should be host:5500.
