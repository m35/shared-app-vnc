Resize bug - When source window was made smaller, the frame wouldn't reduce when run on Linux. Fix was to add getWidth, getHeight, and getSize commands to VncWindow.java. Note how VncWindow.java is structured - it is a JComponent and the image data is written directly to its root pane. VncWindow contains JFrame and JScrollPane objects that surround it's content (JScrollPane(this)). Essentially the JComponent was reporting the wrong size (previous size) and so JScrollPane wasn't resizing appropriately - It was JScrollPane that wasn't resizing and thus JFrame was sizing acording to the ScrollPane.
