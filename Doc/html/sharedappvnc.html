<P>SharedAppVnc is a remote collaboration tool. It allows application sharing
between remote participants. In a typical usage scenario, two or more remote
collaborators would run SharedAppVnc on their desktop computers while
participating in a phone or conference call. After establishing SharedAppVnc
connections, possibly through ssh-tunnels, they would be able to share
(replicate) windows between the remote desktops. The shared windows could
optionally be controlled by the remote viewers, or they could be set to
view-only.</P>
<P>SharedAppVNC is based on VNC (Virtual Network Computer), but with a modified
VNC protocol that allows for window sharing. The main advantage of SharedAppVnc
over traditional VNC is its ability to share individual windows rather than the
entire desktop. Users typically have some applications which should remain 
private, such as email, and some applications they would like to share. Normal 
VNC is only able to share a user's entire desktop 
and thus does not lend itself well to a combination of shared and private data.</P>
<P>SharedAppVnc has two components: a server for sharing windows and a client
for viewing windows. The
SharedAppVnc Server runs on a collaborators desktop computer and allows them to select which windows
from the desktop to share. Only windows they select will be visible to the other
collaborators. The SharedAppVnc Viewer runs on the other collaborator's
computers and allows them to receive the shared windows. Typically collaborators
will run both the Server and Viewer so that they can share and receive windows.
One nice feature of the SharedAppVnc Viewer is that it puts each received window
in its own frame which can be resized or positioned independently of the size or 
position of windows on the server or the other clients. Both the Server and
Viewer can listen for or initiate connections.</P>
<P>SharedAppVnc versions are currently available for&nbsp; Linux and Mac OS X
platforms. We are in the process of adding support for Windows OS.</P>
<h3><a name="screenshots">ScreenShots</a></h3>
<P>Here is a screenshot of SharedAppVnc running on Mac OS X. It is sharing a
Safari browser and Finder window. The second screenshot below is the viewer
program running on Linux. It is showing the content shared from the Mac server.
Notice that the viewer computer can rearrange the window positions regardless of
the positions on the server.</P>
