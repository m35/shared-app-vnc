<p>The Mac OS X version of SharedAppVnc incorporates two pieces of software, a
server and client. The server, which
allows windows to be shared, is a Cocoa application called SharedAppVnc.app. It
can be started by double-clicking on the SharedAppVnc icon from Finder. The
viewer is a java application called sharedAppViewer which can be started from
the SharedAppVnc dialog box or invoked from the
command line. The viewer receives and displays shared windows from remote servers.</p>

  <p>It will open the dialog window interface. The dialog window has three
  tabs:&nbsp;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>&quot;Windows&quot; for managing which windows are shared.</li>
    <li>&quot;Clients&quot; for establishing connections to remote viewer
      clients.</li>
    <li>&quot;Tools&quot; for starting the viewer process and setting up ssh
      tunnels.</li>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>By default a Viewer process is also started when the SharedAppVnc
  application is opened. This allows for recieving shared windows as well as
  sending shared windows. From the &quot;Tools&quot; tab of the dialog box the
  viewer process can be started or stopped. By default is listens for
  connections on port 5500.</P>
  <P>The viewer can also be started as a command line process. See SharedAppVnc
  Linux instructions for details.</P>
  <P>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3><a name="connecting">Connecting to Clients</a></H3>
<p>Typically the server initiates a connection to the client. This can be done
through the SharedAppVnc &quot;Clients&quot; tab in the dialog window. Enter the
client you want to connect to such as &quot;viewerhost:5500&quot;. The default
port for the viewer client is 5500. After clicking &quot;Connect&quot; the
client will show up in the &quot;connected clients&quot; list box if the
connection was successful.</p>

<h3><b><a name="ssh-tunnel">Using SSH Tunnels to connect through a firewall</a></b></h3>
<p>When a client is behind a firewall, it is not possible to establish a direct
connection. In this case it is necessary to set up a secure tunnel that will
forward traffic intended for the client through the firewall. Such a connection
can be made using SSH tunnels. To setup an SSH tunnel it is necessary to use a
third computer (a portal) which both users have access to.</p>
<p><b>Scenario 1: You have a user account on the portal computer</b></p>
<p>If you have a user account on the portal computer, you can log onto the
portal and reserve a port that will be used to direct network connections
through the firewall and to a specified port on the client computer. There is a
dialog window in SharedAppVnc that can help you set up this SSH Tunnel.</p>
<p>To establish the SSH Tunnel, click on &quot;New Tunnel&quot; from the
&quot;Tools&quot; dialog pane. This will open a new SSH Tunnel dialog window.
Select &quot;Outgoing Tunnel&quot; and enter a local and remote port. The remote
port needs to be 5500 because that is the port the viewer client listens on. The
local port can be anything, it is just the port you will be redirecting traffic
through on the portal computer (in our example we'll choose 5501). Then enter
the pathway to the remote computer. If the portal computer is named
&quot;Portal&quot; and the client computer is &quot;RemoteViewer&quot;, then we
would enter &quot;Portal:RemoteViewer&quot;. Then enter your user name on the
portal computer and click &quot;connect&quot;. A dialog window will open asking
for your password on the portal computer. After successfully authenticating and
connecting, you will see your tunnel added to the list box on the
&quot;Tools&quot; dialog pane. Note that the &quot;RemoteViewer&quot; client has
to allow incoming connections to port 5500 (i.e. it's local firewall rules must
allow this traffic in).</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/osx-tunnel-dialog.jpg" width="363" height="365"></p>
<p>Once the SSH tunnel is established, you will have a redirection path that
goes from<br>
<b><i>localhost:5501--&gt;portal:5501--&gt;remotehost:5500</i></b><br>
When you now establish a connection to localhost:5501, that connection will be
redirected to the remote client. The connection can be established as shown
below.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/osx-clients-tab.jpg" width="321" height="391"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Scenario 2: The remote user has a user account on the portal computer, but
you do not</b></p>
<p>If you do not have an account on the portal computer, then the remote user
will need to establish the connection. To do this from SharedAppVnc they will
also open the &quot;New Tunnel&quot; dialog window. But instead of making an
outgoing connection, they will make an incoming connection. To do this they will
select the &quot;Incoming&quot; radio button. For the local port they will enter
5500, this indicates that incoming traffic will be directed to port 5500 on
their computer which is where the viewer is listening. For the remote port they
can enter anything (i.e. 5502), but they will need to tell you the port chosen.
In the remote host box they will just enter the name of the portal
&quot;Portal&quot;. They will enter their username in the username box and click
&quot;connect&quot;. It will ask them for their password to authenticate. Once
they are authenticated they will see the incoming tunnel listed in the
&quot;Tunnels&quot; dialog box. Once the tunnel is established they will tell
you the remote port number they chose, in our case 5502. Then you will connect
to &quot;Portal:5502&quot; and your connection will be redirected to their
computer.</p>
<h3><a name="sharing">Sharing Windows</a></h3>
<p>From the &quot;Windows&quot; tab you can share or hide windows. To share a
window, click on the &quot;Select Window to Share&quot; button and then move
your mouse over the window to be shared and click on it. The first mouse click
after pushing the &quot;Select Window to Share&quot; button will register which
window is selected. Note: If the computer is running mulitple monitors, only
windows from the primary monitor can be selected.</p>
<p><b>Sharing a window:</b></p>
